 Feel free to contact me if you have any additional suggestions or you've
 found a bug. Feedback is always welcome! IF YOU THINK THE SCRIPT IS TERRIFIC,
 I WOULD BE VERY GLAD IF YOU LET ME KNOW THAT.
 And if you think my work kicks ass, please consider donating.



 Donation
~~~~~~~~~~

 Writing this script and providing a solution to make the process as easy
 as it could be, took me a lot of time. I worked on the script in my spare time,
 I didn't make any profit with it. So far I'm only a normal human being like
 everybody else -- plus the interest in the technical background of recovering
 mpeg streams from a hard drive disk. ;)
 Now I'm giving the complete working result (including the whole source code!)
 to everybody. As you can see this is a one-way road.
 If you like my work, please consider donating. I would be very happy about
 this.

 For more information about how to donate, contact me (see above). Thanks.
